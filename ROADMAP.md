# 🗺️ ADRENALINE HUD: 2026 ROADMAP
**Lead Developer:** Adi  
**Goal:** To create the most immersive, all-in-one interface in FiveM history.

---

## 🟢 PHASE 1: Q1 2026 - THE CONNECTIVITY UPDATE
* **Integrated Radio UI:** A sleek, minimal overlay that shows who is talking on your radio frequency with active waveforms.
* **Smart GPS Mini-Map:** A custom-styled square mini-map that changes its zoom level based on your vehicle's speed.
* **Neural-Link Phone Integration:** A HUD-based notification system for phone calls and texts so you never have to pull out your phone to see who's messaging.

## 🟡 PHASE 2: Q2 2026 - THE SURVIVAL EVOLUTION
* **Metabolism v2:** Advanced hunger/thirst icons that "shrivel" or "dry up" as you lose stats, with A.D.I. voice reminders to eat.
* **Dynamic Injury System:** A full-body X-ray that highlights specific limbs (Broken Leg = Limping icon on HUD).
* **Environment Scanner:** Thermal and Night Vision HUD filters that can be toggled via the Neural-Link menu.

## 🔴 PHASE 3: Q3 2026 - THE ECOSYSTEM EXPANSION
* **Adi-Admin Dashboard:** A built-in, 3D spectate menu for admins to watch players, check inventories, and see inputs directly on the HUD.
* **Custom Skin Shop:** An in-game UI where players can use "XP Points" earned from the HUD's XP system to buy new HUD colors and layouts.
* **API for Developers:** Documentation for other developers to create "Plugins" for the Adrenaline HUD.
